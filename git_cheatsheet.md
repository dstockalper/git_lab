Here are the Git commands I remember
git --version:  verifies which version, if any, of git user has installed
git init:  starts tracking the folder I'm currently in.
git add file_name.txt:  adds only the specified file to the git tracking system.
git add .  :  adds ALL files and folders (within our init'd folder) to be tracked.
git add-A  :  adds ALL files EVERYWHERE that have been changed.
git add -u  :  adds only files that have been added before. i.e. won't bring in junk like test.txt.
git commit -m 'my comment'  :  -m is a message.
git status  :  tells you what changes have been made to which files and which of those have/haven't been committed.
ctrl + c  :  'escape' to terminal, in case the cursor is stuck in an unrecognizable mode.
git log  :  i don't know what git log does.
git help  :  shows a list of git commands.
git remote add origin http://github.com...  :  git remote sends a local project to the remote folder on github.
git push -u origin master  :  -u indicates to git to pay special attention to the branch, and anyone adding to the branch will be notified.
git clone https://  :  clones someone else's project from Github on to your own local.
